# Object Oriented Design & SOLID Prinicples

This repository contains the materials for the ETP 2022 to teach some concepts about Object Oriented Design such as cohesion, coupling, constructors, invariants, primitive obsession, named constructors, and so.

During the training course, we also review the SOLID principles:

* **S** Single Responsibility Principle
* **O** Open Closed Principle
* **L** Liskov Substitution Principle
* **I**  Interface Segregation Principle
* **D** Dependency Inversion Principle

# Getting started

- [ ] Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- [ ] Install dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```
- [ ] Run tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
```
- [ ] Run tests watch
```bash
poetry run ptw
```

A part from that, there are a folder with exercises that you can complete in order to master OOP.

Happy Coding!
